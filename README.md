Temprature Calculator is basically a very simple Idea of changing Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius.
I was setting in my office in Germany and it was almost 32Celsius, so i thought how much its gonna be in Fahrenheit so i wrote this Calculator with the help of some
Google & Youtube research etc.
